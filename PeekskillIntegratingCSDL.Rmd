## Welcome/Intros
   
1. Your teaching - who, where, what?
2. Your experience with and/or teaching with Computer Science/Computational Thinking?

## Some Guiding Questions
   
1. What does it mean to integrate Computer Science and Digital Literacy Learning Standards into our work with students?
2. How can we identify areas of intersection?
3. What are the high level opportunities (instead of the low hanging fruit)?

## The Context

- 14 teachers/teacher candidates in a course entitled "CS for Teachers"
- Conducted in a social learning platform built with Elgg software
- Spring 2016 semester


## The Methods
- Students participate in the course via a series of units focused on the history of CS in K-12 schools, core research, and coding via robotics.
- While they worked in this asynchronous course, they were able to interact with the teacher and one another.
- Those interactions were extracted and analyzed.

## Data Analysis, part 1
- Social Network Analysis (SNA) - to visualize student networks for each learning activity
- Every interactions was coded (codebook to follow)
- Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) was used to visualize the epistemic space of each learning activity.

## ELA Examples
A cool tool is [Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com).

```{r, out.width = "1500px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

## Discussion - What Did We Learn?
- Patterns of interactions in open vs closed learning activites

- Evidence of student autonomy and engagement

- Future work
