Course Description
---
We swim in a sea of writing, much of it written by algorithms rather than humans. Automated Writing Systems (AWS) that employ natural language processing techniques are currently used to amplify political messages on social media, to convey sports and financial statistics, to generate click-worthy headlines, as smartphone chatbots, and as creative writing aids. Automated essay scoring, search engine optimization, machine translation, and text processing techniques determine educational outcomes, popularity of websites, or help us to analyze unique features of documents or massive archives. Whether or not we use them ourselves, AWS are shaping the circulation of our writing and the environment in which we read. 

The ability to use complex and sequential language, such as writing demonstrates, is an exclusively human activity. Yet people have pursued ways of automating this human capability for centuries--from mechanized automatons in the 18th century to twitterbots in the 21st. Language is an infinite system, but the translation of language into writing—especially print—discretizes it, suggesting that it may be possible to fully automate. English has 26 letters, spaces and punctuation: how hard could it be to write a system that uses those discrete inputs and writes for us?

Very hard, actually. Using massive datasets and parameters, contemporary AWS like GPT-3 produce passable prose. The comprehension rate for AWS-produced text jumps considerably as the genre narrows: earthquake and sport reports are solved problems. But bypassing the question of can we automate writing? (not really), let's ask instead: why would we want to automate writing? What does it say about humans that we keep banging our heads on this mechanical, computational, philosophical problem of language?  

Automating Writing is a historical and technical dive into why people have developed automated writing systems (AWS), what challenges AWS offer, and how to implement AWS using natural language processing and public data sets. The course brings gendered and racialized histories of office automation and amanuenses for the writing-down of narratives from enslaved people in conversation with contemporary questions in artificial intelligence such as whose intelligence is being simulated and how. We will explore: what writing is; power dynamics in writing; the limits of what computers can do; and the relationship of human consciousness to computation. Hands-on work in AWS-related systems include basic programming; [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) (using Javascript) and [InferKit](https://inferkit.com/) (using GPT-2); Twitterbots; [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life); the [Leibniz cipher machine](https://pitt.libguides.com/leibniz) held by Pitt ULS. Assignments include reading histories of AWS, writing short blog posts analyzing different historical and contemporary AWS or their products, and playing with algorithms and datasets such as GPT-2 (an AWS that uses machine learning and which is publicly available in a scaled-down version). The final project for the course asks you to break the boundaries of the class: develop a unit to teach something you learned here in Pitt undergrad English courses like Composing Digital Media or Narrative and Technology; an online creative project using automated writing; a public art project; a workshop you run for others and document; or another relevant project of your choice. Through readings on algorithms and historical studies of writing automata such as the [Maillardet Automaton](https://www.fi.edu/history-resources/automaton), alongside learning how to use an AWS such as GPT-2, students will get both a theoretical and practical introduction to automated writing systems, contemporary writing and machine learning.


Learning goals
---
Students completing this course can expect to:
- 1.	Consider questions of human identity and existence vis a vis the automata humans create for writing
- 2.	Name several historical automata and their significance for their contemporary engineering, mathematical, scientific and philosophical contexts
- 3.	Experience systems related to AWS that are mechanical or computational
- 4.	Understand how machine learning in textual processing systems such as GPT-2 works using massive datasets and training on specific texts 
- 5.	Produce automated writing using systems such as Tracery or GPT-2
- 6.	Translate automated writing systems into a public instantiation


Assessment
---
30% participation in class discussion (including “deep reading” days)
40% course blog writings and weekly exercises
30% final project

Because this is a grad course, this breakdown should be considered a rough guide rather than a mathematical certainty. Please talk with me if you have questions or concerns.


Course Responsibilities
---

### Blog writings and deep reading weeks
Please choose four weeks that look particularly interesting to you. Choose two of these weeks to write a ~500 word blog post on the readings, activities, or anything else connected to the theme of the week. For the other two weeks, you will read deeply. That is, you will ensure that you are a relative expert on the texts for the week; you will have interesting questions to pose to your peers; you will have thought about connections between texts, etc. You do not have to lead discussion for these weeks, but we will assume you'll be an especially active participant in it. The class will sign up for these weeks at the beginning of the term. 

### Final project
Your final project will take the practices or ideas of automated writing that you've wrestled with in the class out into the world in some way. Some possibilities: a community workshop or lesson plan for a K-12 setting, plus a reflection on this design; a textual public art installation and reflection; a research article that is on a path to journal submission; a website that includes multiple small texts or images or interactions related to automated writing. The format is flexible and later in the term, we will discuss what might work for your specific interests and goals. 

UPDATE: The Final Project submission portal is now (as of 12/6) open on Canvas. You are welcome to turn in your final project anytime during Finals Week, Dec 13-17. I have met with you all individually about your project plans. Please keep in touch as it takes shape to make sure that we're on the same page with it. You will be sharing your project in some form during our final day of class, 12/13.




Course Policies and Resources
---

### Mutual respect
This course draws students from multiple disciplines. We all bring to the course a particular constellation of personal, experiential, academic and professional expertise. Together, can create an open classroom and the sharing of ideas in a safe, respectful environment.  In order to facilitate this open exchange of ideas, as members of this class, we agree that we will not engage in derogatory language, writing, or expressions against race, ethnicity, religion, gender identification, sexuality, economic position, and political views. Any disagreement in class discussion with me or with your fellow students should be respectfully expressed.

### Course format
The format of this course will follow the policies of University of Pittsburgh. Please check [https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/) for policies. We will begin meeting in person and I will communicate any change in format over email.

### Late work
It's better for everyone when you get work in on time: it helps you stay on track; helps you participate in discussion of the work among ourselves; and helps me to manage our teaching responsibilities to you. But stuff happens. Please get in touch if you are encountering a significant challenge to completing your work. Better late than never, and better late than compromised. 

### Absences
Please let me know ahead of time if you will need to be absent from class. I will let you know how you might make up work for the class. Make-up activities do not fully substitute for attendance, but will help you to stay connected to the themes and ideas of the course. Because this is a seminar, more than one absence may affect your participation grade.

### Statement on Academic Integrity
This is a collaborative class, in which we offer each other suggestions and constructive criticism. However, the goal of all this collaboration is to clarify the expression of original ideas – never to substitute someone else's ideas for our own, or to impose our ideas on someone else. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, because Pitt takes a very hard stance on plagiarism. Here's an excerpt from the official Policy on Academic Integrity (required for Pitt syllabi): 

> Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed. 

You have the right to a fair hearing, and I’ll talk to you before we talk to anyone else, but it’s far easier just to avoid plagiarism in the first place. All clear cases of deliberate plagiarism will be referred to the appropriate Dean for disciplinary action, including an Academic Integrity Board hearing. View more on Pitt's policy on the [Provost's website](http://www.provost.pitt.edu/faculty/academic-integrity-freedom/academic-integrity-guidelines).


### Policy on Children in Class
Children are welcome in this class when your role as a caregiver overlaps with your role as a student. If a child is sick, please do not bring them to class--instead, please contact me directly about alternative arrangements such as videoconferencing. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable. I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met. If you have any other parenting needs, please feel free to approach me so that we can work together towards a solution. While we maintain the same high expectations for all students regardless of parenting status, we are happy to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school-parenting balance. 
 

### Inclusivity Policy (Disability Resources)
Your success in this class is important to us. I recognize that everyone learns differently. Although I have designed the course to tap into different learning styles (online participation, f2f participation, videos, text, etc.), I recognize that everyone will find different aspects of the course challenging. Challenge is good! But if there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. If you need official accommodations, you have a right to have these met. 

If you require accommodation for a disability, please inform us and the [Office of Disability Resources and Services](https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/disability-access/disability-resources-and-services) as early as possible in the term. You can reach DRS at (412) 648-7890 or (412) 383-7355 and you can visit their office at 216 William Pitt Union. 

I encourage you to visit me in office hours (see above) to determine how you could improve your learning as well. 

### Support Resources 
There are also a range of resources on campus to support your life as a student, including [the Writing Center](https://www.writingcenter.pitt.edu/) and the [Counseling Center](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/cc/). Pitt Libraries has put together an amazing and comprehesive list of housing assistance, food assistance, etc etc.: [https://pitt.libguides.com/assistanceresources/home](https://pitt.libguides.com/assistanceresources/home)  

### Names and Pronouns Policy
As a graduate instructor, I go by my first name, Annette. Feel free to address me by my first name. I use she/her/hers pronouns.  If you have preferences about pronouns and naming for the class, please let us know and we will respect your wishes. I also request that you respect the wishes of our classroom community.

### Email Communication Policy
If you do not ordinarily use your Pitt email address, please make sure that the Pitt address is forwarding properly to whatever email address you do use, since I will be sending messages this way. I expect that you will read your email regularly and may communicate about any course changes via email. The University provides an email forwarding service that allows students to read their email via other service providers (e.g. Google, Yahoo), but you do so at your own risk. To forward email sent to your University account, go to [http://accounts.pitt.edu](http://accounts.pitt.edu), log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to logout of your account when you have finished. (full [email Communication Policy](https://www.policy.pitt.edu/ao-15-e-mail-communication-policy-formerly-09-10-01))

Before emailing me a question about the course, please check the syllabus to see if your answer is here. I will attempt to answer your emails about the course promptly.


Schedule and Texts
---
Each week of this course we'll explore another facet of automated writing. As with most graduate classes, there is too much to contend with each week. I've listed the texts in order of my own priorities for the class. Yours may be different, and your time available each week will fluctuate. I ask that you do your best to contend with as much of the material as possible each week in order to be prepared for the week's discussion. 

You are not *required* to purchase any books for this course; all readings and texts are available online or through PittCat or will be excerpted and made available in Canvas. I *recommend* that you purchase two books or find a partner in the class to share with: 
* Bertram, Lillian-Yvonne. Travesty Generator. http://www.noemipress.org/catalog/poetry/travesty-generator/
* Shane, Janelle. You Look Like a Thing and I Love You. Voracious, 2019. (On one day reserve at Hillman Library; visit the information desk to pick it up, and check PittCat for availability.)

We'll talk a little about the NaNoGenMo workshop and training language models such as GPT-2 [directions](https://medium.com/swlh/learning-to-write-language-generation-with-gpt-2-2a13fa249024).

Optional: 
Ashley, Kevin D. Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics: New Tools for Law Practice in the Digital Age. Cambridge University Press, 2017. (I will loan you the book if you're interested. It's a good book! But very technical about the law.)

### Alternative activities
Have some of your text read by https://www.paperrater.com/ or https://www.ets.org/erater/about or https://dxrgroup.com/scoreitnow or Turnitin. What is it looking for? Can you game the system like the BABEL generator does?
Write code or pseudocode algorithm for generating a genre you know well (example: [a conference paper title generator I wrote circa 2009](https://www.annettevee.com/conferencepapertitlegenerator/generator.php))
