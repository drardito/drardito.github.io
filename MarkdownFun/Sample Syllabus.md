# Sample Syllabus

This is a sample syllabus to test out whether [HackMD](hackmd.io/) is a viable platform for authoring and publishing such documents.

It is possible that this is the tool I could use to create my course "site?" That is what Annette Vee did. Check out her site [here](https://hackmd.io/lcY0C1mYQhy37R1QAwpxMQ?view#Final-project).

So, let's start.
